# Fishbowl
Final project for CSCI 5239 Spring 2016

Diana Southard

**Instructions**
After compilation, executable will be located in _bin_ directory. The program runs automatically on full screen to show the underwater shader effects. The larger portion of the project is based on the shader program showcasing an underwater scene, with water ripples and bubbles all generated by the underwater fragment shader.

This background shader also includes a family of jellyfish swimming upward across the screen. The jellyfish further back from the screen are supposed to be harder to see and become more transparent, blending into the water.

A number of fish swim in the water. There is a slider that allows for that number to be increased/decreased as desired. The fish swim across the screen wrapping from left to right.
